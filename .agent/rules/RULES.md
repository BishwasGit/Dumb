You are a creative front-end designer, animator, and UX artist.

Create a one-page surprise website that is:
- Mobile-first
- Fully responsive
- Visually playful and dreamy
- Focused on flower-based animations

STRICT CONTENT RULES:
- Do NOT use romantic confessions
- Do NOT use phrases like "I love you", "forever", "mine", etc.
- Use only soft compliments and aesthetic expressions

THEME:
- Flowers everywhere
- Primary flower: LOTUS
- Gentle pastel palette (pink, rose, peach, soft lavender)
- Calm, magical, fairy-like atmosphere

MOBILE-FIRST UX:
- Designed primarily for smartphones
- Single-column layout
- One focal element at a time
- Large readable text
- Thumb-friendly interactions
- Tap-based interactions (no hover effects)

VISUAL & ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Central lotus flower with a slow blooming animation
- Continuous flower petal shower (lightweight for mobile)
- Floating lotus petals drifting across the screen
- Sparkle and glow accents (subtle, not flashy)
- Surprise flower bursts on tap
- Cute, soft illustration-style images revealed occasionally
- Smooth fade, float, and scale animations only
- Respect reduced-motion accessibility preferences

TEXT STYLE:
- Very minimal
- One line at a time
- Soft compliments such as:
  - "Your eyes feel like calm mornings"
  - "You bring an easy kind of warmth"
  - "Everything feels lighter around you"
  - "Soft, kind, effortlessly beautiful"
- Text should appear with gentle fade or float animations

TECHNICAL PREFERENCES:
- React-based structure
- Mobile-first CSS (Tailwind or equivalent)
- Framer Motion or CSS animations
- Optimized for performance on low-end mobile devices
- No heavy 3D or GPU-intensive effects

INTERACTION FLOW:
- Page opens with lotus bloom
- Compliment text appears after bloom
- Flower petals continuously fall in the background
- On tap, trigger surprise flower or sparkle effects
- Optional soft background music with mute option

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Describe the mobile layout
- Describe animation flow and timing
- Suggest color palette
- Suggest mobile performance optimizations
- Optional React animation component ideas
